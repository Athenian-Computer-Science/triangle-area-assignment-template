# Triangle Area Calculator 
## (not done yet!)
The program should calculate the area of a triangle. Unfortunately, it contains several errors. Your task is to correct those errors so it runs correctly.

### Pseudocode 
* get base and height from user
* calculate area and assign the value to a variable
* print the area in a sentence
    * Your sentence format MUST match the expected formatting!

### Example
```
Base of triangle: 5
Height of triangle: 10
Output: The area of the triangle is 25.
```

### Submitting your program
When you are finished, double-check that your output is formatted correctly.

Then, commit and push to GitHub.
* Be sure to go to the GitHub repo and check to be sure your program passed the automatic test.
* If you get a green check-mark, you're done. A red X means you need to make some changes. Double-check the formatting of your print statement!
